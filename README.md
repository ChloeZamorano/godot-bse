# Acorn Engine
Modified Godot to have better support for Sonic Colours: Ultimate.

Current features:
- Version number was changed to 1 due to being Blind Squirrel Engine v1 and not Godot v3
- cast_shadow's default was changed from On to Off
- cast_character_shadow has been added
- Support for importing projects from PCKs, while saving edited files in a specified "work" folder. Said folder also takes priority over files in PCKs.
